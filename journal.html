             <p>To be honest, when I started this semester, I wasn't "thrilled" about this class.
                I felt like there wasn't much I was going to get out of it. I had already taken Web Eng I and II.
                "What could this class teach me that I don't already know or haven't already been taught?" This was a closed
                minded and ignorant approach. As I continued to progress in this class, the world of CSS3 became
                something that went from outside my grasp to something that I now have a belief that I can understand
                and use it to expand my levels of creativity.<br><br>
                I've never thought of myself as a creative person and to be honest, there is more
                that I could've done in this class to develop that skill, but I'm please with
                the progress I did make. What surprised me the most were the things I learned outside of application development.<br><br>
                Professionalism, isn't something that is often talked about in school, let alone in the world. I was
                able to gain a greater value of this characteristic. I've started being more aware of my own personal
                levels of professionalism at work. There are some minor areas for improvement and I have set goals and made plans
                to make steps forward to improve them. I hope I can maintain a high level of accountability to myself, enough to hold
                firm to the success of my improvements.<br><br>
                Needless to say, I have been humbled this semester, which is something I didn't think was needed, because I'm
                not someone who typically thinks very high of himself. Regardless, the Lord saw fit to humble me even more.
                Not only was I humbled academically, but I was humbled in regards to how I treat my family during times of
                stress. Early in my schooling, I was so dedicated to my family and didn't allow school to take me away from
                spending time with my daughter. (It was so important to me that no matter how much school work I had, that I HAD to
                brush her teeth and read her bedtime stories.) I have two children now and I hate to say this mentality that I embodied
                for so long, took a backseat this semester. It's sad to me, because I think my relationship with my daughter has suffered
                a bit. Granted, she's 3, but my wife, my daughter, and my son are my world and I can't forget this feeling. I can't forget
                that I regret every night where I didn't brush her teeth or read either of them bedtime stories, because when I get that
                amazing development job (and I have faith that I will), I absolutely cannot forget where I live, who my world is, and
                the relationship that I want with my family...the relationships that will last far longer than those I develop within my chosen
                career.</p>
